IR Sensor is an electronic device that can, for example, measure the heat of an object or detect its movement.
This sensor can be implemented for applications such as:
- parking sensor
- bathroom light switch-on sensor
- faucet sensor
- sensor for determining the temperature of a body

**The project I carried out had in mind the implementation and imitation of a parking sensor or a sensor for determining the proximity of a body.**
